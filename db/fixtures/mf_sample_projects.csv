 The recognition includes an opportunity for Sarah Oktay, director of the Nantucket Field Station, to share information about the youth collaborative at the annual OBFS meeting in September, as well as reimbursement for the cost of attending the meeting.

 In granting the Human Diversity Award, The OBFS team cited the Grossman Youth Collaborative for serving urban schools throughout Massachusetts which provides high-school and middle-school students with a weeklong, expenses-paid trip to Nantucket. 

 ""We are thrilled to receive the 2012 OBFS Human Diversity Award,"" Oktay said. ""The youth program is very special. Many of the kids who come here have only experienced their own urban environments. To be able to introduce them to the ocean, to Nantucket's natural beauty, and even to a clear night sky full of planets and stars is an honor for those of us involved in the collaborative.""",f,2014-01-21 15:33:10.348179-05,2012-07-01 01:00:00-04,2000-01-01,

The demographic makeup contrasts with the City as a whole, which is 75% white. The median household Income in the Point is $38,635, 31% lower than the citywide figure of $56,203. Fifty-eight percent of renter households are housing cost-burdened.  Unemployment is a hallmark issue in the Point neighborhood where the unemployment rate is 11.6%, compared to 7.3% citywide. This Plan, which will focus on the Congress and lower Lafayette Street corridor, will identify areas with housing and economic redevelopment potential in the Point, a historically underserved neighborhood in the City of Salem. It may increase opportunities for immigrant owned small businesses and increase the overall vitality of the neighborhood. The outcomes of this project may directly impact people in protected classes including: national origin, familial status, age, and source of income.",t,2014-03-05 14:23:13.803908-05,2014-03-05 14:23:13.803938-05,2014-03-06,2014-12-31
