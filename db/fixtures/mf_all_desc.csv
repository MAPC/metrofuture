1,Community PlanIt,"MAPC is collaborating with the Emerson College Engagement Game Lab (EGL) to develop and implement a new location-based social media game that is an exciting new option for engaging diverse constituents in a conversation about the future of their community.  Community PlanIt (CPI) is an on-line social media game that responds to a growing concern among city planners, government officials, and community organizers that too few voices are represented in important local planning efforts. With its focus on community learning, deliberation, and participation, CPI engages a broad range of stakeholders in important decisions, allowing them to be informed participants in their communities. Along with the Asian Community Development Corporation and the City of Quincy, MAPC and EGL hosted an instance of the game in North Quincy in early 2012, and another instance in Salem's Point Neighborhood is set to begin.

The draft language can be modified by the Town Planner and Planning Board to suit a specific community, and presented to Town Meeting for incorporation into town zoning bylaws. The goal was to provide communities with information and tools to make informed decisions about parking so that the demand and supply are balanced and appropriate.

The draft regulations are organized into three topic areas, and include 12 parking strategies selected by Town Planners and others working with MAPC. The three topic areas are: 

Parking for Alternative Vehicles 
Managing the Parking Demand 
Managing the Environmental Impacts of Parking.

56,Walk Winthrop,"Walk Winthrop was developed as a broad concept for a series of walking routes throughout the Town of Winthrop connecting businesses, recreation points, beaches, and other points of interest. MAPC was brought in to help develop an implementation plan and refine the concept to one that can be completed in short order. MAPC worked with Winthrop to develop a route system of 3 routes throughout town, including one major route, the Ocean Route, which would be incorporated into the proposed regional greenway system.

The Ocean Route is proposed as the signature walking route that serves as the extension of the East Boston Greenway through Belle Isle Marsh to the beaches of Winthrop, ending at Deer Island. The route follows existing trails and walks along three beaches, as well as connected low traffic streets. The trail system will provide economic development to the town with increased tourism, and support for the new ferry service to Boston.

In addition to the WalkWinthrop greenway system, the implementation plan recommends steps forward for the Hubway bike share program, bicycle accommodation on town streets, and a “safe routes to schools” program. In all, the plan forms a comprehensive approach to active transportation for residents seeking active healthy lives, and brings new people into the town providing economic development through sustainable travel.",http://mapc.org/sites/default/files/FINAL%20MAPC%20DLTA%20Report%20for%202011.pdf,project_tn/Winthrop_ma.jpg,"","",3,"",com,s,f,,t,2012-07-17 00:19:17-04,2012-07-01 01:00:00-04,2000-01-01,

Among the dozen original communities engaged with the feasibility study, Chelsea, Revere and Winthrop eventually requested the hired consultant to look specifically at the feasibility of a three community consolidated dispatch.

In September of 2010, the three communities received a report from the firm RCC Consultants, Inc. which concluded that Revere’s public safety facility (the new Police Headquarters located along Revere Beach Parkway) was adequate to house a consolidated dispatch for the three communities with certain work space expansions and operational changes.

In early 2011, the three communities received District Local Technical Assistance funding to enable MAPC to assist in procurement of a project management firm to guide the communities into a consolidated dispatch. Soon after the receipt of the grant, Chelsea withdrew from the project.

171,Advancing State Housing Policies,"MetroFuture calls for a wide range of housing types in a variety of community types to reflect the changing household composition and demographics in Greater Boston. MetroFuture sets the stage for our region to achieve housing goals. Eight of the detailed goals relate specifically to housing, while three others relate to the intersection of housing/jobs and smart growth. 

Completion of the Regional Housing Plan and Regional Analysis of Impediments/ Fair Housing and Equity Assessment will refine our key policy and implementation priorities. These priorities will serve several purposes that include ensuring the equitable availability of housing throughout the region to all “protected classes”; expanding the resources available for the production and preservation of affordable housing; assisting policymakers at the state and local levels in allocating housing assistance equitably and effectively; identifying housing opportunities for the private market; and facilitating alignment of the region’s housing resources with its anticipated needs going forward. Even while that planning is underway, the MA Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) is updating a number of their housing programs and launching new ones.  

This work will enable MAPC and other members of the Consortium to collaborate with DHCD to improve and expand a number of critical housing programs. The goal is to shape these initiatives to place greater emphasis on location (e.g., developing in smart growth locations with infrastructure and public transportation access); to achieve greater efficiency of housing program (e.g., collaborating across municipal lines); to improve program effectiveness (e.g., more units produced); and to enhance equity outcomes (e.g., more units available and affordable to very low-income households and various protected classes).

A group of municipal GIS specialists from Arlington, Concord, Reading, and Andover sought to reduce these costs by forming a consortium of municipalities to procure the imagery for a larger region collaboratively at a much lower cost per square mile. MAPC worked with this group to develop a memorandum of understanding between Arlington and participating municipalities to document agreement on the terms of payment and delivery. Nearly 60 municipalities ultimately signed the agreement to join a spring 2014 flyover.

300,North Shore Biotech Consortium,"MAPC is providing ongoing technical assistance, facilitation of partner meetings, developing links to federal funders:

The Life Science sector in Massachusetts continues to thrive, with the industry expanding at a double digit compounded annual growth rate despite the recession. Discoveries such as DNA and RNA sequencing are catalyzing the creation of thousands of jobs in the Commonwealth and across our nation. To fill – and retain – those jobs in Massachusetts there is a recognized need to train and retain students we educate here.  Advances in the field are also creating a need to re-train workers to operate and maintain the most important current and emerging bioinstrumentation. A related unmet industry need comes from the region’s early-stage biotech companies, the engine of future industry growth, which cannot afford the expensive new instrumentation needed to develop their innovations, increase their productivity and foster their growth. Similarly, our teaching colleges cannot afford to purchase such current advanced, industry-standard tools and therefore cannot graduate populations of students prepared to step into, and compete for, high quality Life Science jobs here. In recognition of these unmet needs, five North Shore institutions joined together to form the North Shore Biotech Consortium (the Consortium): Endicott College, Gordon College, Salem State University (SSU), North Shore Community College (NSCC), and North Shore InnoVentures, Inc. (NSIV), a non-profit business incubator. We believe our Consortium is the first of its kind in the nation, with its mission to educate the next generation of Life Science students and train them on the next generation instrumentation; improve placement of interns, graduates and workforce re-trainees in the region; and grow the region’s biotech sector. The Consortium aligns academia, industry, and government in an impactful collaboration.

The outcomes of this project may directly impact people in protected classes including: national origin, familial status, age, and source of income.",t,2014-03-05 14:23:13.803908-05,2014-03-05 14:23:13.803938-05,2014-03-06,2014-12-31
